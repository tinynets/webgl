# Learning WebGL

From the ground up, will start with no THREE.js or anything like that until I understand the basics inside out and can be comfortable drawing and manipulating things in webgl including shaders.

- [x] setup simple drawing mechanism
- [ ] do the same with webgl so i can understand how user input translates to graphics on canvas
